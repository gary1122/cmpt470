CMPT 470  Group 8 final project.
Using ExpressJS and other tools to build a Drawing&Guessing game-like web app.
- For checkpoint:
    did basic login and UI; implemented drawing Canvas
    localhost:8080


-For final product
 Two canvas, one for free drawing, on for game using.
 The free drawing on can be accessed without logging in(our idea is to attract players this way).

 Game room: able to create, join by name, join from the list
 Guessing: able to set answer, guess answer according to player turns. Have a timer to count down.

 Chat room: when in the lobby, everyone can see the chat. when join a room, only sees the roomchat.

 We maintained a lot of alert boxes for tracking the behaviours(easier for people to know if it's working), please enable alert boxes/ keep them in browser
